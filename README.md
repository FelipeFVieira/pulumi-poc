# Pulumi POC

This repository contains a Proof of Concept (POC) using Pulumi, an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool. The purpose of this POC is to demonstrate how Pulumi can be used to provision and manage cloud resources (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) programmatically and efficiently.

## Objective

The main objective of this POC is to explore the capabilities of Pulumi in comparison to other IaC tools, such as Terraform and CloudFormation. This POC will provision and manage the following resources:

- [List the resources being provisioned: EC2 instances, S3 buckets, VPCs, etc.]
- [Other cloud services you're working with, e.g., Lambda, DynamoDB, etc.]

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (if you're using JavaScript or TypeScript)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (if you're using Python)
- [Cloud Provider CLI] (e.g., AWS CLI, Azure CLI)
- [Cloud Account] (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)

### Authentication Setup

Follow the instructions below to authenticate with your cloud provider:

- **AWS**:  
  - Configure AWS credentials using `aws configure`
  
- **Azure**:  
  - Authenticate with Azure CLI using `az login`
  
- **Google Cloud**:  
  - Set up the Google Cloud SDK with `gcloud auth login`
